<blockquote><p>The <b>dog</b> are often called "man's best friend" for good reason. They are loyal,
     loving, and offer companionship that can improve our physical, emotional, and mental well-being. 
    <mark> Whether its a playful puppy or a calm, older dog, they can bring joy, comfort, and security to 
     their owners.</mark> Dogs encourage an active lifestyle through walks, runs, and playtime, helping to 
     keep their humans fit and healthy. Their natural ability to sense emotions and offer unconditional 
     affection makes them perfect companions for people of all ages, providing emotional support and 
     reducing feelings of loneliness. In addition to being great pets, many dogs serve in important 
     roles, such as therapy animals, guide dogs for the visually impaired, or even working dogs in 
     search and rescue missions. Overall, dogs bring immense value to our lives with their love, 
     loyalty, and ability to enrich our daily experiences. </p></blockquote>
